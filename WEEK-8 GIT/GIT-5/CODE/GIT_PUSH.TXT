Git Lab Task – Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Verify if 'master' is in a clean state

Command:
git checkout master
git status

Expected Output:
- If successful, you’ll see: “On branch master” and “nothing to commit, working tree clean”.
- If ‘master’ doesn't exist or throws an error, ensure it has at least one commit.

Step 2: List out all the available branches

Command:
git branch -a

Expected Output:
- A list of branches, for example:
  * master
    Git-T03-HOL_002
    remotes/origin/master
    remotes/origin/Git-T03-HOL_002

Step 3: Pull the remote Git repository to the master

Command:
git pull origin master

Expected Output:
- You’ll see Git fetching and merging any changes from the remote 'master' into your local 'master'. If everything is up-to-date, it will say: “Already up to date.”

Step 4: Push the changes from “Git-T03-HOL_002” to the remote repository

Command:
git checkout Git-T03-HOL_002
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Committing pending changes from Git-T03-HOL_002"
git push origin Git-T03-HOL_002

Expected Output:
- If there are changes, they will be pushed to the remote repository under the branch ‘Git-T03-HOL_002’.

Step 5: Observe if the changes are reflected in the remote repository

Command:
git fetch origin
git log origin/Git-T03-HOL_002 --oneline

Expected Output:
- The recent commits should appear, confirming that the push in Step 4 was successful.
- Alternatively, go to GitHub and select the ‘Git-T03-HOL_002’ branch to verify the changes.
