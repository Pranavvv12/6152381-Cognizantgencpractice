EXPLANATION:

When you use .gitignore the files mentioned in the git ignore is ignored and did not pushed into the github or the repository.This helps when it comes to large data like node modules which is not necessary to push as the other side user will use npm install to install the node modules whereas if we transfer it it requires large data and time.
